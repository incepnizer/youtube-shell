# Youtube Design Clone
As part of my HTML and CSS learning journey, I created a website that mirrors the design features of entertainment juggernaut Youtube.com. 

## Techniques  
* The site was coded completely in HTML and CSS
* Various integral CSS properties such as Flexbox, Grid, and absolute and relative position were used
